; Sequences are in FASTA format. The datafile contains the entire genome in a single file, 
; whose records can be scaffolds, contigs, chromosomes. The names of these sequences must 
; match those in the annotations.

[advanced]
; The following options are usually best left "as is" unless you know what you're doing.

; The preferred source whose annotations to use.
source=EVM

; Feature types to retain during pre-processing.
feature=CDS
feature=gene

; Number of sequences to lump in one file. Must be <= 10,000
chunksize=5000

; Minimum length of sequences to retain. Must be >= 200
minlength=200

; Number of sequences to write (used for testing). Set to 0 for all sequences.
limit=0

; Minimum length of introns to retain. Must be >= 10. In genes that have smaller introns 
; all CDS features are lumped to create a non-coding pseudogene.
minintron=10

; Location of the tbl2asn executable. If this is set to tbl2asn=tbl2asn then the 
; assumption is that it is found on the PATH.
tbl2asn=linux64.tbl2asn

; Verbosity. Can be 0, (errors only), 1 (also warnings), 2 (also info messages) or 
; 3 (also debugging messages)
verbosity=2

; Logging complexity. 0=only show log level and message; 1=also show fully qualified 
; method name, code file and line number
complexity=1
