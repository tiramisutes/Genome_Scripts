; NCBI guidelines for naming proteins:
;
; - If it exists, use the approved nomenclature.
; 
; - Use a concise name, not a description or phrase. You'll get warnings if >100 
;   characters
;
; - Ideally the name should be unique and attributed to all orthologs.
; 
; - The protein name should not contain specific characteristics of the protein, and it 
;   should not reflect the function of the protein, its subcellular location, its domain 
;   structure, its molecular weight or its species of origin. This information can be 
;   included in the note.
;
; - In cases where the protein name is not known use "unknown" or "hypothetical protein" 
;   as the product name. We recommend the use of "hypothetical protein" as this will allow 
;   the locus_tag identifier to be appended to the product name in BLAST and Entrez 
;   summary lines.
;
; - Protein names may be denoted by the same symbol as the corresponding gene, but the 
;   symbol begins with a capital letter.
;
; - Avoid the use of molecular weights in protein names "unicornase subunit A" is 
;   preferred to "unicornase 52 kDa subunit"
;
; - Do not use the term "homolog" in a protein as this infers an evolutionary relationship 
;   that has generally not been determined.
;
; - Where possible, avoid the use of commas in protein names
;
; - Use lowercase letters, except when uppercase are required (for example, in acronyms 
;   such as DNA or ATP).
;
; - Wherever appropriate, the name should use American spelling conventions.
;
; - Avoid the use of Roman numerals where possible. Use instead Arabic numbers.
;
; - Do not build molecular weights into abbreviations
;
; - For proteins that belong to a multigene family, it is recommended that you choose a 
;   coherent nomenclature with numbers to specify the different members of the family.
;
; - When naming proteins which can be grouped into a family based on homology or according 
;   to a notion of shared function, the different members should be enumerated with a dash 
;   "-" followed by an Arabic number. e.g. "desmoglein-1", "desmoglein-2", etc.
;
; - Greek letters must be written in full e.g. "alpha", and written entirely in lower case 
;   with the exception of "Delta" in the context of steroid/fatty acid metabolism 
;   nomenclature. Additionally the Greek letters that are followed by a number should be 
;   preceded or followed by a dash "-" e.g. "unicornase alpha-1".
;
; - Do not use diacritics, such as accents, umlauts. Many computer sytems (ours included) 
;   can only understand ASCII characters.
;
; - Do not use plurals in a protein name. e.g. "ankyrin repeats-containing protein 8" is 
;   wrong.
;
; - Proteins of unknown function which contain a defined domain or motif, can be named 
;   according to the domain present. The name should be of the following type: 
;   "<domain|repeat>-containing protein". e.g. "PAS domain-containing protein 5".
;
;
; Evaluate the output from 'discrep' and pay particular attention to warnings such as the
; follow:
; - May contain database identifier more appropriate in note; remove from product name
; - Contains underscore
; - Three or more numbers together
; - Putative Typo
; - Is all capital letters
; - May contain plural
; - contains 'Fragment'
